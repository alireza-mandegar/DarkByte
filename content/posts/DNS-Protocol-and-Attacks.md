# DNS Protocol & Attacks

> DNS Stands for Domain Name System

- **DNS (Domain Name System):**
  
  - Translates human-friendly domain names (e.g., `www.amazon.com`, `www.netflix.com`) into numeric IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the Internet.

- **The Human vs. Computer Paradigm:**
  
  - Humans can easily remember domain names, while computers rely on numeric IP addresses (e.g., IPv4 like `51.2389` or IPv6 like `2400:CB00:2048:1::C629:D782`).

- **DNS as the Internetâ€™s Phonebook:**
  
  - Functions similarly to a phonebook by allowing users to look up a domain name and retrieve the corresponding IP address.
  - Eliminates the need for humans to memorize or manually input complex IP addresses.

- **Critical Role in Internet Functionality:**
  
  - Enables everyday tasks such as online shopping, banking, and streaming by seamlessly connecting domain names to the correct servers.
  - Without DNS, the usability of the Internet as we know it would be significantly diminished.

- **Beyond Basic Name Resolution:**
  
  - While the basic function of DNS is to translate names to IP addresses, its underlying architecture is more sophisticated and versatile.
  - Further course content will explore these complexities in greater detail.
